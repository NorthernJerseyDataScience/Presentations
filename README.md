# Presentations
A repo to host all the presentations for the NJDS Meetup group.


##NJDS_MachineLearning
This is the supervised Machine Learning tutorial presented on [May 7th, 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Northern-Jersey-Data-Science-Meetup/events/221757524/)
This tutorial is entirely self-contained. No data files need to be imported.

##DataDive
This is the DataDive example I (Manojit) made with several other members of the group on [July 26, 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Northern-Jersey-Data-Science-Meetup/events/224029988/).
We explored the San Francisco Crime dataset provided by [Kaggle's San Francisco Crime Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime).
The data files are too large to upload to GitHub, so any users wishing to replicate the results of this notebook need to download the data from Kaggle.
This Jupyter Notebook produces a submission file that places within the top 150 (top 25%) of submissions.
